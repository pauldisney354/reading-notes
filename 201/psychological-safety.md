## Discussion Questions

### 1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- **Open communication:** Team members are encouraged to share their ideas and feedback, knowing their input is valued.
- **Trust and mutual respect:** A sense of respect for each otherâ€™s opinions and skills allows team members to collaborate effectively.
- **Support for risk-taking and mistakes:** Teams that embrace learning from failures without punishment foster an environment where people feel safe to experiment and innovate.

### 2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
- Reflect on any past teams you've been part of (e.g., in the Navy, in web development, or medical settings). Consider how open communication, trust, and the ability to make mistakes were handled. For example, in a team where **psychological safety** was present, members might have felt comfortable suggesting improvements to procedures or challenging established processes without fear of repercussions. Contrast this with environments where silence was maintained due to fear of judgment or retribution.

### 3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
- **Impact on the company:** High psychological safety results in more creative problem-solving, innovation, and overall productivity. Teams feel empowered to tackle challenging problems and contribute their best ideas.
- **Impact on team members:** When employees feel psychologically safe, they experience less stress, greater job satisfaction, and a sense of belonging. This encourages personal and professional growth, as well as stronger team cohesion.
