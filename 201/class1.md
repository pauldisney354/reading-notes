# Class 01 Reading Assignment

## Why This Topic Matters
Understanding how the web works, along with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is crucial as it forms the foundation of web development. This knowledge enables us to create dynamic, interactive websites and better comprehend how users interact with digital content. The skills acquired in this module are directly applicable to my future projects as a developer.

## Reading Notes

### How the Web Works
- The web functions using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS to communicate between clients (browsers) and servers. This is the backbone of web interaction.

### Website Design and Process
- **First Step in Designing a Website:** Identify the target audience and the website's purpose.
- **Key Question in Website Design:** What actions do you want users to take on your website?

### JavaScript Basics
- **What is JavaScript?** A programming language essential for creating dynamic and interactive web content.
- **Comments in JavaScript:** Use `//` for single-line comments and `/*...*/` for multi-line comments.
- **Strings vs. Numbers:**
  - **String:** A sequence of characters (e.g., `"Hello World"`).
  - **Number:** Numerical data (e.g., `42`).
- **Variables:** Named storage for data that can change, crucial for data manipulation in programming.

### Introduction to HTML
- **HTML Document Structure:** An HTML document includes a doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
- **HTML Attributes:** Provide additional information about elements, defined in the start tag (e.g., `<img src="image.jpg">`).
- **Anatomy of an HTML Element:** Comprises a start tag, content, and an end tag (e.g., `<h1>Title</h1>`).
- **Differences between `<article>` and `<section>`:**
  - `<article>` is a standalone composition; `<section>` is a thematic grouping.
- **Typical Website Elements:** Common elements include headers, navigation menus, main content areas, and footers.
- **Metadata and SEO:** Metadata informs search engines about content, influencing SEO; it’s specified using the `<meta>` tag.

### Semantics
- **Using `<h1>` over `<span>`:** `<h1>` is semantically meaningful for top-level headings, enhancing accessibility.
- **Benefits of Semantic Tags:** Improve SEO and accessibility by providing clear document structure.

### JavaScript in the Browser
- **Two Uses of JavaScript:**
  1. Form validation to ensure proper user input.
  2. Manipulating the DOM for dynamic content updates.
- **Adding JavaScript to HTML:** Use the `<script>` tag or link an external file.

### Poem on HTTP
```markdown
When you click on a link and send a request,  
Data travels through wires, it’s put to the test.  
From your browser to servers, they quickly align,  
HTTP whispers, “Here’s your data in time.”  

Bits and bytes dance in packets so small,  
Transporting your message, it answers the call.  
From text to images, all content flows free,  
HTTP’s the magic that connects you and me.
