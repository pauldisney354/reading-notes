### Review on Local Storage

#### 1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Developers use **local storage** for its ability to store data persistently in a user's browser. Key advantages include:

-   **Persistent storage**: Data is retained even after the browser is closed and reopened.
-   **No server interaction**: Reduces server load by storing data locally.
-   **Fast access**: Provides quick read/write access for user-specific preferences, settings, or session-related data.
-   **Offline capabilities**: Enables web applications to function offline by saving necessary data locally.  
    Examples:
-   Saving **user preferences** (e.g., theme, language settings).
-   Storing **progress in a game or form input** during sessions.

----------

#### 2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

Storing sensitive or large data in local storage poses risks. Developers should avoid storing:

-   **Sensitive information**: Avoid passwords, personal information, or credit card details due to lack of encryption.
-   **Highly confidential application data**: As local storage can be accessed and manipulated by anyone using the browser's developer tools.
-   **Large datasets**: Local storage is limited to about 5MB per origin.

----------

#### 3. What type of data can local storage store? How would you convert it before storing?

Local storage can only store data as **strings**. If your data is in another format, you must **convert it to a string**.

-   **Simple strings**: Can be stored directly.

    
    `localStorage.setItem('username', 'Paul');` 
    
-   **Objects and arrays**: Must be converted to JSON strings before storage. Use `JSON.stringify()` to serialize the data.
    

    
    `const user = { name: 'Paul', role: 'developer' };
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));` 
    
-   **Retrieving and converting back**: Use `JSON.parse()` to deserialize the data.
    

    
    `const retrievedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
    console.log(retrievedUser.name); // Output: Paul`

### What is JSON?

JSON (**JavaScript Object Notation**) is a lightweight data format used for **storing and exchanging data**. It is easy for humans to read and write and simple for machines to parse and generate.

-   **Structure**: Consists of key-value pairs, arrays, or nested objects.
-   **Data Types Supported**: Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.
-   **Example**:
    
    
    `{
      "name": "Paul",
      "role": "developer",
      "skills": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
      "active": true
    }` 
    

JSON is widely used in web development for transferring data between a server and a web application.

### What is Data Persistence?

**Data persistence** refers to the ability of data to remain available and unchanged even after the application is closed or the system is powered down.

-   **Key Features**:
    -   Data is stored in a durable medium (e.g., disk, database, local storage).
    -   Ensures data continuity between sessions.

In web applications, data persistence allows for features like remembering user preferences or retaining form inputs when revisiting a site.

### What is Local Storage?

**Local storage** is a web storage feature that allows developers to store key-value pairs of data in a user's browser.

-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Persistent: Data remains available until manually cleared.
    -   Scope: Limited to the origin (protocol + domain + port).
    -   Capacity: Approximately 5MB per origin.
-   **Usage**:
    
    
    `// Save data to local storage
    localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
    
    // Retrieve data from local storage
    const value = localStorage.getItem('key');
    
    // Remove a key from local storage
    localStorage.removeItem('key');`

### Where is Local Storage Stored?

Local storage data is stored in the **browser's storage area on the user's device**.

-   **Desktop Browsers**: Stored in files within the user's profile directory on the local filesystem.
-   **Mobile Browsers**: Stored in internal application storage managed by the operating system.

Examples of file paths:

-   **Google Chrome**:  
    On Windows:
    
    sql

    
    `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage` 
    
    On Mac:
    
    
    `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage` 
    

Browser tools (like Developer Tools) provide an interface for viewing and managing local storage.
