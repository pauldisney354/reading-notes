# CSS Layout - Flexbox

## Flexbox Overview

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox is optimized for laying out items in a **single direction** at a time, either horizontally (row) or vertically (column). It simplifies alignment and distribution of space within a container when compared to older layout techniques like float or inline-block.

- **Key takeaway**: Flexbox is best suited for scenarios where items are laid out in a linear fashion, such as navigation bars or rows/columns of cards.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- **Main Axis**: Defined by the `flex-direction` property, the main axis is the direction along which the flex items are arranged. For example:
  - `row` → horizontal axis (left to right by default)
  - `column` → vertical axis (top to bottom by default)
- **Cross Axis**: Perpendicular to the main axis. If the main axis is horizontal (`row`), the cross axis is vertical, and vice versa.

The distinction helps control how items are aligned within the flex container.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

1. **Order Property**: The `order` property rearranges the visual order of items without changing their DOM order, which can confuse screen readers and keyboard navigation.
2. **Flex-grow, shrink, or basis**: These properties can break layouts if not tested for different viewport sizes or zoom levels, affecting users relying on visual scaling or responsive layouts.
3. **Focus/Keyboard Navigation**: Overcomplicated flex layouts can lead to unexpected tabbing sequences if elements aren’t logically ordered in the DOM.

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

- **Simplified Alignment**: Flexbox makes it easy to align items both horizontally and vertically without extra CSS (e.g., `justify-content` and `align-items`).
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts spacing, alignment, and distribution for different screen sizes.
- **Fewer Hacks**: Flexbox eliminates the need for clearfix or manual margin/padding tricks often required when using floats.
- **Order and Wrapping**: Flexbox allows reordering of elements and wrapping them onto new lines more easily.
