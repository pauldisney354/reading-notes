Starting an intravenous (IV) line is a key medical skill. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of the process, but make sure to follow your specific training and protocols in a clinical setting.

Steps to Start an IV
Prepare Supplies:

IV catheter (select the correct gauge for the situation)
Antiseptic swabs (alcohol or chlorhexidine)
Tourniquet
Saline flush (optional, but standard for testing patency)
IV extension set or saline lock
Tape and transparent dressing
Gloves and protective equipment
Position the Patient and Choose a Site:

Make the patient comfortable, usually with their arm extended.
Apply the tourniquet 3-4 inches above the intended insertion site to engorge the vein.
Choose a vein, typically in the forearm or back of the hand. Avoid joints if possible.
Prepare the Site:

Don gloves and cleanse the area thoroughly with an antiseptic swab. Allow the area to dry.
Insert the IV Catheter:

Hold the catheter at a 10-30 degree angle with the bevel up.
Insert the catheter until you see a flash of blood in the flash chamber.
Lower the angle and advance the catheter slightly to ensure it's in the vein, then advance only the catheter, not the needle, into the vein.
Stabilize and Secure:

Release the tourniquet and remove the needle, keeping the catheter in place.
Attach the extension set or saline lock, then flush with saline to confirm patency.
Secure the IV with tape and a transparent dressing.
Document:

Document the IV site, size of the catheter, number of attempts, and any patient reactions.
Additional Tips:
Gauge selection: Choose based on the patient's vein quality and required infusion rate.
Angle control: Shallow angles help with superficial veins, while slightly steeper angles can help with deeper veins.
Practice: Inserting an IV is a skill that improves with practice, so hands-on experience in a supervised setting is essential.
