**Psychological Safety in My Work Experience**

Psychological safety played a crucial role in my previous work experience, particularly during my time as a Navy Hospital Corpsman. In high-pressure environments, having the ability to speak up without fear of judgment or repercussions was essential for both patient safety and team efficiency. In situations where psychological safety was high, open communication led to better teamwork, improved morale, and more effective problem-solving. Conversely, in environments where team members felt hesitant to express concerns, errors were more likely to go unnoticed, and collaboration suffered.

**Moving Forward**

This article has reinforced the importance of fostering psychological safety in any team I work with. Moving forward, I will prioritize creating an environment where team members feel valued and heard. This includes actively listening to others, encouraging open discussions, providing constructive feedback, and acknowledging contributions. By fostering a culture of trust and respect, I can help build stronger, more effective teams.

**REST and HTTP Protocol**

1.  **Who is Roy Fielding?** Roy Fielding is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the creator of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. He helped define how web applications communicate over the internet.
    
2.  **Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** Many traditional techniques, such as using direct function calls or proprietary protocols, do not scale well for global communication. REST, built on standard HTTP methods, ensures that different systems can interact seamlessly regardless of their underlying technology.
    
3.  **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a standard for communication between clients (browsers, applications) and servers. It defines how requests and responses are formatted and processed over the web.
    
4.  **What does a GET do?** A GET request retrieves data from a server. For example, `GET /users` would return a list of users from an API.
    
5.  **What does a POST do?** A POST request sends new data to a server to create a resource. For example, `POST /users` with user details would create a new user.
    
6.  **What does PUT do?** A PUT request updates an existing resource by replacing it entirely. For example, `PUT /users/1` with new user data would overwrite user 1’s information.
    
7.  **What does PATCH do?** A PATCH request updates specific parts of an existing resource instead of replacing it completely. For example, `PATCH /users/1` with an updated email would modify only the email field.
