## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

The four important features to look for in a text editor are:
1. Code completion
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. A nice variety of themes such as reducing eye strain.
4. The ability to choose from a selection of extensions.

## What do the following commands do?

pwd: Print Working Directory. This shows where we are currently.

ls: List the contents of a directory.

cd: Change Directories. This tells the system to move to another directory.

mkdir: is used to create new directories(also called folders) in your file system.

touch: Creates a blank file.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? 

cd projects: The cd propmpt tells the system to move from one directory to another while projects is the name of the directory you want to go to.

mkdir new-project: The mkdir prompt makes a new folder while new project is the name of the folder.

touch new-project/newfile.md: the touch prompt creates the new file, newproject is the directory, newfile.md is the name of the file with .md indicates the extension being a markdown file.

cd ..: This propmt helps you navigate to the previous directory.

ls projects/new-project: ls lists the contents of a directory. projects/new projects will list the files within new projects within the projects folder.
