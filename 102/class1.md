# Learning Markdown

What is Markdown?

Markdown is a language that uses symbols that you have to add around words instead of using keyboard inputs to change the format and appearance of text.

Why do we use Markdown?

Markdown is used because it is a universal editing and creating tool that can be used right away without the need for subscriptions or making an account. You can start using it as long as you know the correct placement of symbols you need to make the changes.

What symbol can make a heading in Markdown?

The # symbol is used to make a heading in Markdown, but it must be at the  beginning of your line of text and a space directly after.

How many do you need to create the largest heading?

# You need one # to create the largest heading. Example: # Heading 

How many do you need to create the smallest heading?

###### You need six # to create the smallest heading. Example : ###### Heading 

When making text **bold** or *italicized* for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

When making text **bold** or *italicized* for emphasis, it is ***best practice*** to use ** ** to bold a word and * * to italicize.
 
How do you create a link with Markdown?

To create a link in Markdown, you need to enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Google]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://www.google.com/)).

An example would be my favorite search engine is [Google](https://www.google.com/).

What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

The three symbols you need to use to create an unordered bulleted list are dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.
The best practice is to use one of the symbols and stick with it to make the list.
An example using dashes in front of line items would look like:

- First Item
- Second Item
- Third Item
