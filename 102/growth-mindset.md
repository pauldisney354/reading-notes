## Growth Mindest
In my own words, growth mindset is the daily personal choice to refuse to allow challenges that you face diminish your chance of personal success and fullfilment.
### 3 reminders to keep yourself in the growth mindset
1. Do not give in to negative thoughts. 
2. Picture what your future would like if you were to give up.
3. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
